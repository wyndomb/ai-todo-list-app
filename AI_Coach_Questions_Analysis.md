# AI Productivity Coach - Question Analysis & Capabilities

## ‚úÖ Current Issue Analysis - RESOLVED

**Problem:** "What's coming up?" returns generic response instead of showing upcoming tasks
**Root Cause:** Missing intent detection for future/upcoming task queries
**Impact:** Users can't get quick insights about their upcoming schedule

**‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

- Added `upcoming_summary` intent with comprehensive pattern matching
- Added upcoming task data processing (this week, next week)
- Added smart response generation with date grouping and priority indicators
- Updated UI with "Upcoming" quick action button
- Added "What's coming up?" to welcome message examples

## Completion Time Handling Strategy

**Approach:** Track `completedAt` for data consistency but avoid misleading time-specific insights

**Why:** Users often complete tasks but mark them as done later, making exact completion times unreliable for productivity insights.

**Implementation:**

- ‚úÖ **Keep:** Date-based patterns (daily/weekly/monthly trends)
- ‚úÖ **Keep:** Completion counts and streaks
- ‚ùå **Avoid:** Hour-specific productivity claims ("completed at 2:30 PM")
- ‚ùå **Avoid:** Time-of-day productivity patterns ("most productive 9-11 AM")

**Example Messaging:**

- Instead of: "You completed 'Review reports' at 10:30 AM"
- Say: "You completed 'Review reports' today"
- Focus on: Daily completion counts, weekly patterns, streaks, and date-based trends
